# BotRunner
Discord Bot that I will run on a RaspberryPi that allows others to run their own bot from

Note* this will have low security at the start so be careful who you allow to run bots on your device.


## How to use
1. Make a discord bot and publish it on GitHub
2. Make a separate bot that will use the BotRunner script
3. Make a file containing bot tokens and store it in the BotRunner project (same directory as the main file)
4. Run the BotRunner with the token from the bot in step 2
5. to be continued...
